# Expense-Tracker
This is a demo application for expense tracking

Thank you very much for the opportunity. In this demo application, I was trying to use some new technologies that I have not tried earlier.

My main intension was to showcase my interst of using new android development technologies. 

Some of the technologies that I have used in the project,

1. Jetpack Compose UI 
2. Hilt dependency injection
3. Kotlin Flow for coroutines


Future improvements

1. Editing an expense is not saving the edited value.
2. Instead of using the text input field for category, using the dropdown item already created.
3. Assigning certain color for a certain category by default.
